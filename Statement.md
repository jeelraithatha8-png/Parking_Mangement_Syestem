# 1. Problem Statement
The complexity of managing multi-level parking lots manually often leads to inefficiencies, inaccurate fee collection, and user frustration due to misplaced vehicles or incorrect spot assignments. A technical solution is required to accurately track vehicle entry/exit, calculate fees automatically, and optimize spot utilization.

# 2. Scope of the Project
The scope of this project is to build a backend Java application that handles the core operational logic of the parking system. This includes managing spot allocation, handling ticket lifecycles, and calculating duration-based charges. The project focuses on demonstrating the correct application of OOP, data structures, and algorithms learned in the subject. Out of scope: A graphical user interface (GUI) or integration with external payment gateways.


# 3. Target Users
Parking Attendants: Users responsible for vehicle entry and exit scanning.

System Administrators: Users who monitor parking capacity and manage spot configurations.

End-Users (Drivers): Users who interact with the system upon entry and exit.

# 4. High-Level Features

Entry/Exit Transaction Processing 


Vehicle-Type Based Spot Matching 


Automated Fee Calculation 


Parking Spot Availability Reporting
